Making a release
===

To make a release of OpenSync, do the following:

 - check out a fresh copy from subversion

 - increment the version number in configure.in

 - "make distcheck" (DO NOT just "make dist" - pass the check!)

 - if make distcheck fails, fix it.

 - Run "make check" again several times to try to see race conditions.
   You can also use the osyncstress tool.

 - once distcheck succeeds, "svn commit"

 - if someone else made changes and the commit fails,
   you have to "svn up" and run "make distcheck" again

 - once the commit succeeds, "svn cp trunk branches/opensync-0.XX"

 - upload the tarball to releases. make sure the version numbers are the same!

 - Annouce the release on the mailing list
