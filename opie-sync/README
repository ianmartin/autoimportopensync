Opie Plugin for OpenSync README
===============================

This OpenSync plugin is intended to allow synchronisation with the Opie 
handheld environment. Please see http://opie.handhelds.org for more 
information on Opie. In theory it should also support some versions of Qtopia 
as found on the Sharp Zaurus but no testing of this has been done.

This plugin is a work in progress but should be able to sync contacts, 
calendar events and todo list entries, minus a few fields. However, use 
is entirely at your own risk - back up your data on both sides first!

If you'd like to help, please try the plugin and send any questions, patches 
or corrections to the opensync developers list 
(opensync-devel@lists.sourceforge.net). Thanks!


Configuration Options
---------------------

url
  IP address or hostname (not actually a URL) eg. 192.168.0.2

username
  User name to log into the device as (default root).

password
  Password to log into the device with (default rootme).

device
  Device type being connected to:
    opie    - Opie or compatible OS (default)
    qtopia2 - Qtopia 2.0 or compatible OS (eg. Zaurus with original ROM).

port
  TCP port to use for file transfers. Default is 4242.

conntype
  Connection type to use:
    ftp  - use FTP (default)
    scp  - use SFTP
    none - don't connect. Useful for debugging only - will expect the device 
           files to sync with to be in /tmp.

use_qcop
  Control the use of QCOP to notify the device of syncing:
    true  - enable QCOP (default)
    false - disable QCOP. Only really useful for debugging.

backupdir
  (Optional) If you want the files from your device backed up prior to every 
  sync, set this option to a directory to put the backups into. A directory 
  named using the current date and time will be created for each backup. 
  Files will also be written to this directory in the event that uploading to 
  the device fails.
  Note that old backups are not purged - you will need to do this yourself.
