Opie Plugin for OpenSync README
===============================

This OpenSync plugin is intended to allow synchronisation with the Opie 
handheld environment. Please see http://opie.handhelds.org for more 
information on Opie. In theory it should also support some versions of Qtopia 
as found on the Sharp Zaurus but no testing of this has been done.

This plugin is a work in progress but should be able to sync contacts, 
calendar events and todo list entries, minus a few fields. However, use 
is entirely at your own risk - back up your data first!

If you'd like to help, please try the plugin and send any questions, patches 
or corrections to the opensync developers list 
(opensync-devel@lists.sourceforge.net). Thanks!
