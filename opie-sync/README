Opie Plugin for OpenSync README
===============================

This OpenSync plugin is intended to allow synchronisation with the Opie handheld environment. Please see http://opie.handhelds.org for more information on Opie.

This plugin is still a work in progress and is not really useful for anything yet. At the moment it can only read and write contact data and won't sync correctly.

If you'd like to help, please send any questions, patches or corrections to the opensync developers list (opensync-devel@lists.sourceforge.net). Thanks!
