Opie Plugin for OpenSync README
===============================

This OpenSync plugin is intended to allow synchronisation with the Opie 
handheld environment. Please see http://opie.handhelds.org for more 
information on Opie. In theory it should also support some versions of Qtopia 
as found on the Sharp Zaurus but no testing of this has been done.

This plugin is a work in progress but should be able to sync contacts, 
calendar events and todo list entries, minus a few fields. However, use 
is entirely at your own risk - back up your data on both sides first!

If you'd like to help, please try the plugin and send any questions, patches 
or corrections to the opensync developers list 
(opensync-devel@lists.sourceforge.net). Thanks!


Configuration Options
---------------------

url
  IP address or hostname (not actually a URL) eg. 192.168.0.2

username
  User name to log into the device as (default root).

password
  Password to log into the device with (default rootme).

device
  Device type being connected to:
    opie    - Opie or compatible OS (default)
    qtopia2 - Qtopia 2.0 or compatible OS (eg. Zaurus with original ROM).

port
  TCP port on the device to use for file transfers. Default is 4242.

conntype
  Connection type to use:
    ftp  - use FTP (default)
    scp  - use SFTP - currently broken
    none - don't connect. Useful for debugging only - will expect the device 
           files to sync with to be in /tmp.

use_qcop
  Control the use of QCOP to notify the device of syncing:
    true  - enable QCOP (default)
    false - disable QCOP. Only really useful for debugging.

backupdir
  (Optional) If you want the files from your device backed up prior to every 
  sync, set this option to a directory to put the backups into. A directory 
  named using the current date and time will be created for each backup. 
  Files will also be written to this directory in the event that uploading to 
  the device fails.
  Note that old backups are not purged - you will need to do this yourself.



Troubleshooting
---------------

I see the error "Failed to log in to server"

  This is most likely because you have not set the security options properly
  on the Opie side. Go to Settings->Security->Sync and set the
  "Accept sync from network" option to an appropriate value for your network
  setup.


Syncing freezes at a particular point

  This is most likely caused by attempting to sync with another plugin that
  supports object types that the opie-sync plugin does not support (eg. notes).
  These types should be disabled in your syncing frontend or the sync will not
  complete successfully. (This issue will be addressed in a future version of
  OpenSync).

  Alternatively, an error may be occurring during the sync which is not being 
  shown in the output - please report this problem to the OpenSync mailing list 
  (opensync-users@lists.sourceforge.net). If you can, enable the OpenSync 
  tracing feature and look through for any messages that include "ERROR".




Todo list
---------

UID mapping

  The plugin maps external UIDs from other plugins to Opie UIDs by writing
  an internal map to an XML file. In the future this should be taken care of
  by the OpenSync engine itself.

Missing fields on todo list items

  "Business web page", "Gender" and "Children" fields from the Opie side are
  not currently handled.

Alarms

  Alarms are not currently synchronised for calendar events.

Timezone handling

  The plugin does not do any time zone conversion yet.

SCP support

  SCP support is currently broken.

Qtopia testing / support

  No testing has yet been done with Qtopia on Zaurus devices.

Notes syncing support

  This would probably be done by reading and writing text files from a set
  location on the handheld (eg. the home directory) as Opie has a text editor
  instead of a traditional notes application.
