Building a rpm
===

the opensync syncml plugin already contains a ready to use spec file so building an RPM is a
piece of cake. All you need to do is:

        rpmbuild -ta <tarball>

where <tarball> is the current plugin tar ball. You can create this tarball by specifing

	make dist


As long as you have the necessary prerequisites the package should build just
fine.

The packages needed for building the rpm are:

        * libsyncml-devel
        * libopensync-devel
