OPENSYNC SYNCML CLIENT PLUGIN README
====================================

This is a SyncML client plugin based on the SyncML C++ API from 
http://www.funambol.org. The plugin can synchronize contacts (vcards)
and calendar (ical) data.  

The configuration is kept in two places. The SyncML stuff is housed in gconf.
This is documented in the funambol docs. At least the server URL,
name and password must be set.

The rest is kept in the syncML xml configuration file:

Key		 Default		Notes
gconf-uri	 /syncml-client		The base URI for gconf config.
sync-source-name card			A subtree under spds in gconf to
		 			configure the database
object-type	 contact 		For syncing vcards

The plugin can't sync both contacts and calendar in the same sync - they
require quite different configurations. It could configured for any of those,
though. While syncing one type of object,  other types should be filtered,
someting like:

$msynctool  --sync syncml-file --filter-objtype event --filter-objtype todo


Syncing contacts
================
 - Create a syncgroup just to handle contacts.
 - Configure the syncml-client: object-type should be 'contact', and 
   sync-source-name should point the proper entry under spds/sources
   in the gconf tree. Using the default sources it is 'card'.
 - configure the other side of the plugin.
 - Check that server URL, name and password is configured in gconf,
   under apps/syncml-client/spds/syncml
 - Check that the source (default) used is properly configured. Specifically,
   the uri attribute should be checked against server documentation.
 - run it with something like
   $msynctool  --sync evo2-syncml-sw \
     --filter-objtype event --filter-objtype todo

Syncing calendars
================
 - Create a syncgroup just to handle the calendars.
 - Configure the syncml-client: object-type should be 'event', and
   sync-source-name should point the proper entry under spds/sources
   in the gconf tree. Using the default sources it is 'cal'.
 - configure the other side of the plugin.
 - Check that server URL, name and password is configured in gconf,
   under apps/syncml-client/spds/syncml
 - Check that the source (default) used is properly configured. Specifically,
   the uri attribute should be checked against server documentation.
 - run it with something like
   $msynctool  --sync evo2-syncml-sw \      
        --filter-objtype contact --filter-objtype todo
