The usual stuff
================

This plugin depends on the syncml-client package I have derived from
the sources from http://www.funambol.org. At the time of writing, you
should find it on the same place you found this. Download, build and
install that package before you try this one.
 
Once syncml-client is in place the installation of this plugin is 
(should be?) straightforward. 

- autoreconf -sfi
- configure
- make 
- make install

Configure SyncML server
=======================
Gconf handles the this. You must at least set the server URI, user and
password. This is done through the gconf GUI, find the items under:

/apps/syncml-client/spds/syncml: server name, server URL, username, password.

/apps/syncml-client/spds/sources/{the source you configure to opensync}:
     Check the "dir" parameter (should exist) and the uri pararm - it should
     conform to the server documentation. The installed uri is OK against
     scheduleworld.com.
    
Configure sync group
=====================

This is handled by the normal msynctool procedures, something like this:

$msynctool --listplugins
  <check for syncml-client-plugin>
$msynctool --listobjects
  <check for an object you want to sync i. e., "contact">

$msynctool --addgroup syncml-file
  <a simple test case, sync the server to a directory>
$msynctool --addmember syncml-file syncml-client-plugin
$msynctool --addmember syncml-file  file-sync
$msynctool --configure syncml-file 2 
   < set the directory to sync with >
$msynctool --configure syncml-file 1 
   < set the three strings, see below>

Syncml client configuration
===========================

The plugin  handles three configuration strings:

gconf-uri:   The base for Gconf config. Leave this as the default 
             /apps/syncml-client.

object-type: Set to either "contact", "event", "todo" or "note" to sync the
             corresponding items.

sync-source-name:
             Name of the database definition in SyncML API. Found in
             gconf as one of the children of /apps/syncml-client/spds/sources.
             The preconfigured ones are "card", "cal", "note" and "task",
             choose one of them (or add your own).
