 * base class for all transport agents - the TransportAgent of the
 * original distribution is just not usable. The class handles the
 * attributes url, proxy and useCheckConnection. It also 
 *Â manages a buffer for the message received from the net. The
 * actual transfer to/from the server is delegated to derived
 * classes. Such classes must implement at least
 *
 *  - sendMessage() - send a message to server and read response.
 *  - strdup_mbsrtowcs() - convert an UTF string to wide char( Unicode ),
