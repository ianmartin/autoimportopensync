This is the SyncML client plugin for opensync, based on a port of the
SyncML C++ API from http://www.funambol.org.

The thing consists ot two packages: the SyncML API package under 'api'
and the plugin code under 'plugin'. Install the API package first.

To checkout the packages:

$svn checkout \
   http://svn.opensync.org/plugins/syncml-client/plugin/tags/release-0.1 plugin

$svn checkout \
   http://svn.opensync.org/plugins/syncml-client/api/tags/release-0.1 api

The API package is built in the directory development/src.

Enjoy,
