OpenSync Plugin for Google Calendar
(c) Copyright 2006 Eduardo Pereira Habkost <ehabkost@raisama.net>


Requirements:

 - Python <http://www.python.org>. It doesn't use the python plugin
   support for OpenSync, but uses a helper program written in Python
 - httplib2 python module <http://bitworking.org/projects/httplib2/>


Known limitations:

 - Proxy support is missing, because httplib2 has not support for this
 - Recurrent events aren't supported. The helper program will abort
   if there are recurrente events on your calendar
 - Not all google calendar fields are synchronized
