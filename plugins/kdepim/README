Compiling and installing kdepim_plugin
--------------------------------------
    $ autoreconf -sfi
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ su
    $ make install


Troubleshooting
---------------
If the configuration step fails (ie: autogen.sh) make sure you have the
correct versions of autoconf (2.59) (it should work with 2.58, though)
and automake (1.9.2) installed and they are not being overshadowed by
other versions that may be installed.

    $ autoconf --version
    autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.59
    Written by David J. MacKenzie and Akim Demaille.

    $ automake --version
    automake (GNU automake) 1.9.2
    Written by Tom Tromey <tromey@redhat.com>.

Other versions of autoconf and automake may work, but have not been
tested.
