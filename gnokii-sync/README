OpenSync plugin gnokii-sync
===========================

This a _experimental_ OpenSync plugin for Nokia cellphones. Don't use it 
without a whole backup of your phonebook, todo list and calendar! This 
plugin is based on gnokii which can be found on http://gnokii.org
It is recommended to use the latest version of gnokii.

	And don't forget to BACKUP everything - BEFORE syncing!

A introduction how to build, install and configure gnokii-sync can be found
in the INSTALL file. Troubleshooting guide is also included in INSTALL.

BUGS/KNOWN PROBLEMS:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* gnokii (at the moment!) can read but NOT write:
	Info:
	^^^^^
	This bugs will lead to wrong hash calculation after further syncs => MODIFICATIONS.
	Possible workaround is to ignore this information on hash calculation.

	EVENT (Calendar):
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	- Location of Meeting Notes (calnote->mlocation)
	
	- Reminder/Alarm cannot be written for Meeting notes

	- Notes with type Reminder, they will appear as Memos. Older Nokia 
	  phones only support 4 calendar types , no reminder - only memo. 
	  (calnote->type)
	
	- End Time of a Meeting. End Time on the phone will be equal to Start 
	  Time. (calnote->end_time)

	- Phone Numbers of Calling Notes cannot be written (gnokii version 0.6.11)

	- ... 

* alarm (reminder) of all day events will no be synced. cellphone can set
  specific time and not only minutes before/after begin of event. no idea
  how to handle this :( kdepim will remind on 00:00:00.

* conflict handling doesn't work well. gnokii-event doesn't have any priority and other nodes
  which are missing while comparing xml-events with compare_vevent(). Mabye a own compare_func
  without comparing the priority and other missing fields will help(?).

* the gnokii-sync plugin doesn't support all object types (notes, todo, contact) so it is
  recommended to filter out this object types. This can be done with the latest revision 
  (subversion) of msynctool-cli with --filter-objtype:
  	msynctool --sync gnokii-kdepim "--filter-objtype note "--filter-objtype contact --filter-objtype todo

TODO:
^^^^^
* event format:

	# How to handle Birthday notes for PIMs?
		- filtering to contacts?
		- event with yearly recurrence?
		- both?
		
	# check for a fit calendar type:
		A note from another plugin with a unknown calendar category will set 		
		by default to reminder type. A better solution is to check the
		detailed information and decide for a calendar category which fits.
		This will lead to a modification on further syncs. Possible solutions:
			- filtering content
			- add additional calendar category to source entry

	# write destroy function
	# print function (written, but never tested)
		
* contact format
* todo format
* notes format:
	# writing into calendar as memo entry?
	
* testing with other connection then bluetooth
* suggest default gnokii-sync configuration when ~/.gnokiirc is present
