OpenSync plugin gnokii-sync
===========================

This a _experimental_ OpenSync plugin for Nokia cellphones. Don't use it 
without a whole backup of your phonebook, todo list and calendar! This 
plugin is based on gnokii which can be found on http://gnokii.org
It is recommended to use the latest version of gnokii.

	And don't forget to BACKUP everything - BEFORE syncing!

A introduction how to build, install and configure gnokii-sync can be found
in the INSTALL file. Troubleshooting guide is also included in INSTALL.

BUGS/KNOWN PROBLEMS:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* nokia cellphones can't store alarm after event. Entry without reminder will be stored on
  the phone. (If your cellphone support alarm after event contact me! :)

* conflict handling doesn't work well. gnokii-event doesn't have any priority and other nodes
  which are missing while comparing xml-events with compare_vevent(). Mabye a own compare_func
  without comparing the priority and other missing fields will help(?).
  [Update]: This should/will be fixed in the engine of opensync.

* the gnokii-sync plugin doesn't support all object types (notes, todo) so it is
  recommended to filter out this object types. This can be done with the latest revision 
  (subversion) of msynctool-cli with --filter-objtype:
  	msynctool --sync gnokii-kdepim --filter-objtype note --filter-objtype todo

TODO:
^^^^^
* event format:
	# How to handle Birthday notes for PIMs?
		- filtering to contacts?
		- event with yearly recurrence? [done] 
		- both?
		
	# check for a fit calendar type:
		A note from another plugin with a unknown calendar category will set 		
		by default to reminder type. A better solution is to check the
		detailed information and decide for a calendar category which fits.
		This will lead to a modification on further syncs. Possible solutions:
			- filtering content
			- add additional calendar category to source entry

	# print function (written, but never tested)
		
* contact format
* todo format
* notes format:
	# writing into calendar as memo entry?
	
* testing with other connection then bluetooth
* suggest default gnokii-sync configuration when ~/.gnokiirc is present
* prepare for API changes of libgnokii > 0.6.12
* timezone handling
