OpenSync plugin gnokii-sync
===========================

This a _experimental_ OpenSync plugin for Nokia cellphones. Don't use it 
without a whole backup of your phonebook, todo list and calendar! This 
plugin is based on gnokii which can be found on http://gnokii.org
It is recommended to use the latest version of gnokii.

	And don't forget to BACKUP everything - BEFORE syncing!

A introduction how to build, install and configure gnokii-sync can be found
in the INSTALL file. Troubleshooting guide is also included in INSTALL.

BUGS/KNOWN PROBLEMS:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* nokia cellphones can't store alarm after event. Entry without reminder will be stored on
  the phone. (If your cellphone support alarm after event contact me! :)

* the gnokii-sync plugin doesn't support all object types (notes, todo) so it is
  recommended to filter out this object types. This can be done with multisync-cli 
  with --filter-objtype:
  	msynctool --sync gnokii-kdepim --filter-objtype note --filter-objtype todo

  !!! Otherwise gnokii-sync hangs (deadlock!) while syncing !!!
  !!! It is really really really recommended to make use filter todo and note out !!!

TODO:
^^^^^
	# print function (written, but never tested)
		
* contact format
  	# find limits for subentries
	
* todo format
	# todo support in libgnokii is broken at the moment for nk6510 devices (2006-08-01)

* notes format:
	# writing into calendar as memo entry?
