Hi everyone!

Here is what you have to do (atm) to test 0.90:

./configure
notice that dbus-dev is missing
install dbus-dev
make

At the moment 0.90 requires some hand tweaking to start
mainly since the install routines are not finished.

start multisyncd from src:
cd src
./multisyncd

multisyncd knows the following command line switches atm:

--config /path/to/config	(self explanatory)
--plugin plugin_name		(explained below)
some more you dont need to know atm and might disappaer

so... to start the multisyncd in server mode do the following
( in the src directory )
./multisyncd --config ../data/config/multisyncd.conf

If it doesnt start do: export MSYNC_DEBUG=1 to see the debugging
messages

to start a plugin (this is for example how plugins that always listen
in the background for a palm for example are started) do:
./multisyncd --config ../data/config/multisyncd.conf --plugin libpalm_sync
the plugin_name has to be either
- a name of a library where the path is in the ldconfig without a ending (.so)
- a name of a lib with a ending
- the complete path

to start the cli go to interfaces/cli
do: export PYTHONPATH=../../python/.libs
and do ./test.py for a shell script
and ./command.py for a interactive curses based version
in the curses version press c to get it to read the 
syncgroups and syncmembers installed on the server
(in the data/datadir directory if you used the above config)

I have a .cdtproject and a .project file for the fans of eclipse ready to use :)
