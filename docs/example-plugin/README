Hi,

so you are interested in writing a plugin for the
OpenSync synchronization framework... Great! :)

Here is what you have to do:

Edit the files

AUTHORS
INSTALL
LICENSE

and fill in the required information. Then edit:

CMakeLists.txt

and add any checks, dependencies (FIND_PACKAGE(...) statements), etc that you need for you plugin
to function.

Then go to src/ and edit:

CMakeLists.txt

there to suit your needs and include the necessary library paths. Afterwards take a look at the example
source files of the sync plugin

plugin.c
plugin.h

and start writing the functions you need to connect, read and write
etc to your device.

Then edit the default config file which must be the same name
as your plugin:

plugin-name

if you need to write a format plugin take a look at

format.c

Afterwards create a build directory in any location you like and run:

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_PREFIX=/path/to/the/install/dir /path/to/example_plugin
make
make install

If you need help, feel free to ask on the opensync mailing lists:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensync and go to "Lists"

or ask on our irc channel:
server: irc.freenode.org
