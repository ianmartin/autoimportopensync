version 0.01: initial version, only contact sync working... very buggy ;)
version 0.02: added appointment and todo handling, but still very buggy.. ;)

* Add preliminary support for configuration (as outlined by OpenSync).
* Add a source file to support synchronizing files on the WinCE device,
  hook it up to the main plugin source.

version 0.03: bugfixes: connection hangup after commit // calendar report wrong object type

* Make the configuration work for file sync (allows specifying more than one
  directory to synchronize).
* Add some test code to learn how to work with SynCE. There's also a simple
  test program hidden in src/synce_file.c that currently lists all the files
  it finds on the WinCE device.
