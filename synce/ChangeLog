version 0.01: initial version, only contact sync working... very buggy ;)
version 0.02: added appointment and todo handling, but still very buggy.. ;)

* Add preliminary support for configuration (as outlined by OpenSync).
* Add a source file to support synchronizing files on the WinCE device,
  hook it up to the main plugin source.

version 0.03: bugfixes: connection hangup after commit // calendar report wrong object type

* Make the configuration work for file sync (allows specifying more than one
  directory to synchronize).
* Add some test code to learn how to work with SynCE. There's also a simple
  test program hidden in src/synce_file.c that currently lists all the files
  it finds on the WinCE device.
* More of the necessary hookups between SynCE's file access and OpenSync are
  now in place but the implementation is still incomplete and crashes.

* Strip some functionality from the XML based configuration. Only one
  directory can be specified, and the other stuff is meant to disappear too - 
  only the mechanism for enabling/disabling stuff from the GUI is to remain.
  This is as Armin suggested.

* Rename the structure in synce_plugin.h so it has "synce" in its name. Make
  the include file safe against multiple inclusion, add a copyright.
* Add a function (synce_list_directories) that needs to be linked into the
  configuration GUI.
* Clean up the code to use the new fileFormat structure in <opensync/file.h>.
* Don't use %c format in strftime, it causes warnings about two digit year
  format on some systems.

* Use Armin's suggestions about what was wrong. Blush.
* Add basic function to add a file to the CE device, probably not completely foolproof yet.
* remove the initial part of the path (the directory in which the whole sync
  is rooted) to remove confusion caused by that
* Handle creation of subdirectories, and files in them.

TODO
- debug situation with a professionally used agenda (hundreds of meetings) ->
  crashes at present when synchronizing
- debug situation with e.g. both files "cc" and "cc.txt" present on the
  device -> OpenSync appears to tell file-sync to delete "cc", I guess
  it gets mixed up somehow. Is SynCE confusing OpenSync ?
- Debug situation in which a file has been synchronized, but is then deleted
  at both ends (but is still in the OpenSync database).
- Debug the GUI.
