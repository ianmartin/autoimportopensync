Making a release
===

To make a release of OpenSync, do the following:

 - check out a fresh copy from subversion

 - increment the version number in ./CMakeLists.txt 

 - Run "make Experimental" again several times to try to see race conditions.

 - Commit the increased version changes (and build fixes)

 - if someone else made changes and the commit fails,
   you have to "svn up" and run the tests again

 - once the commit succeeds, "svn cp trunk tags/opensync-0.XX"

 - create tarballs with "OPENSYNC_RELEASE=1 cmake .; make package_source" (out of source build!)

 - upload the tarball to releases. make sure the version numbers are the same!

 - Annouce the release on the mailing list
