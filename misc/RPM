Building a rpm
===

OpenSync already contains a ready to use spec file so building an RPM is a
piece of cake. All you need to do is:

	rpmbuild -ta <tarball>

where <tarball> is the current OpenSync tar file (e.g. opensync-0.14.tar.gz).

As long as you have the necessary prerequisites the package should build just
fine.

The packages needed for building the rpm are:

	* libxml2-devel
	* glib2-devel
	* sqlite-devel >= 3.0.0
