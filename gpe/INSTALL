Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   Like most of Opensync, the GPE plugin now uses scons for building.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `scons' to build the package for your system.  

  2. Optionally, type `scons check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  3. Type `scons install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `scons -c'.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Type `scons -h' to see the options that can be specified for the build.

   If other changes are required, type `man scons' to see the detail on
modifying the SConstruct and SConscript files which control the build.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `scons install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `scons' the
option `prefix=PATH'.

Optional Features
=================

   Type `scons -h' to see the options that can be specified for the build.

   Type `scons -H' to see the options for scons itself.
