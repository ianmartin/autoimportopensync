  <!-- There are three ways to connect to the GPE device:
	
	1) You can use gpesyncd locally (if opensync is running
	on the same system) by specifying:

	<use_local>1</use_local>
	<use_ssh>0</use_ssh>

	In this case, no other tags are used.

	2) You can use SSH to connect to the device by specifying:

	<use_local>0</use_local>
	<use_ssh>1</use_ssh>

	In this case, the <handheld_ip> and <handheld_user> tags are used.

	Note that the handheld_ip can be a name or an address and may be
	associated with a particular identify file in the ~/.ssh/config
	file to allow automatic login.

	Also note that for the Nokia Internet Tablet, the handheld_user
	should be specified as "user".

	3) You can connect to a running gpesyncd daemon by specifying:

	<use_local>0</use_local>
	<use_ssh>0</use_ssh>

	In this case, the <handheld_ip> and <handheld_port> tags are used.

  <!-- All tags are set to their default values below -->
  <use_local>0</use_local>
  <use_ssh>1</use_ssh>
  <handheld_ip>127.0.0.1</handheld_ip>
  <handheld_port>6446</handheld_port>
  <handheld_user>gpeuser</handheld_user>
