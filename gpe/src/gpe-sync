  <!-- There are three ways to connect to the GPE device:
	
	1) You can use gpesyncd locally (if opensync is running
	on the same system) by specifying the <local>...</local> option.

	In this case you can also specify <command>shell command</command>
	to change the shell command which is invoked.  However, specifying 
	the <command> tag is not recommended: the default command is:
	gpesyncd - -remote (note the two hyphens should be adjacent but cannot
	be placed together in an XML comment).

	2) You can use SSH to connect to the device by specifying the
	<ssh>...</ssh> option.

	In this case, the <handheld_ip> and <handheld_user> tags can be used.

	Note that the handheld_ip can be a name or an address and may be
	associated with a particular identify file in the ~/.ssh/config
	file to allow automatic login.

	Also note that for the Nokia Internet Tablet, the handheld_user
	should be specified as "user".

	In this case you can also specify <command>shell command</command>
	to change the shell command which is invoked.  However, specifying 
	the <command> tag is not recommended: the default command is:
	gpesyncd - -remote (note the two hyphens should be adjacent but cannot
	be placed together in an XML comment).

	3) You can connect to a running gpesyncd daemon by specifying the
	<remote>...</remote> option.

	In this case, the <handheld_ip> and <handheld_port> tags can be used.

  Either customise the <ssh> configuration shown below or remove it and uncomment
  one of the other sections.  Each section is configured to show the default values
  used if the tags are not specified. 
  -->
  <ssh>
    <handheld_ip>127.0.0.1</handheld_ip>
    <handheld_user>gpeuser</handheld_user>
  </ssh>
  <!--
  <local>
  </local>
  -->
  <!--
  <remote>
    <handheld_ip>127.0.0.1</handheld_ip>
    <handheld_port>6446</handheld_port>
  </remote>
  -->

  <!--
  The <calendar> tag can be used to specify which GPE calendar
  should be used for this synchronisation.  If the <calendar>
  tag is specified then only the named calendar is considered
  (only events in that calendar wil be sent from GPE and all
  events sent to GPE will be stored in that calendar).  If the
  <calendar> tag is not specified, then all events, from all
  calendars, will be sent from GPE and new events will be created
  in the default calendar.

  Note that an error occurs if the named calendar does not exist.
  Also note that calendar names are case-sensitive.

  <!-- <calendar>Some Calendar</calendar> -->
