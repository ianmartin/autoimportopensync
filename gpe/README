This is a plugin for opensync (www.opensync.org) to sync with handhelds
using GPE (http://gpe.handhelds.org).

WARNING: This plugin is not yet finished. A lot of functions are still not yet
written. Although there should be no damage to your files, it is not
guaranteed that it works, so make backups!

This plugin needs the gpesyncd installed on the gpe side. Syncing is done
by using ssh, so this too has to be installed. The easiest way is to use
key authentication. At the end of this document is a small howto to use
it.

Some notes on how all works:
All the conversion of the vcards, vevents and vtodo's is done on the gpe
device by using the gpesyncd. This plugin makes a normal ssh-connection
to the pda, runs there the gpesyncd and makes all queries to it. gpesyncd
converts all the data in the sqlite databases to vcards, vevents and vtodos,
that are sent back to opensync.

Should there be any problems with the conversion, the problems are probably
adressed to gpesyncd. Please look at its BUGS file before reporting a
conversion problem.

Otherwise, see BUGS for known problems.

Have fun.

Some personal notes:

A BIG THANKS to google, for making the "Summer of Code"
(http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html).
and a BIG THANK AS LEAST AS BIG AS TO GOOGLE, to handhelds.org for doing all
this great stuff and letting me code this while the summer of code for you.
I REALLY enjoyed it (and hopefully still enjoy it).

Using key authentication:
At first, you need to generate a new ssh-key pair with

$ ssh-keygen -t dsa

I recommend you to choose a passphrase althought you don't need one. After it
you have two keys: id_dsa and id_dsa.pub. The id_dsa is you private
key, never loose it, never give it away.
Now you need to append the contents of id_dsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
on the gpe device. If the file does not exist, create one.
Now on your desktop run

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_dsa

And enter the passphrase for you private key. This will add your key to the
ssh-agent, which manages all the authentication of the ssh-connections.
Now you won't anymore need to re-enter you passphrase while your X-session
is running and you can connect to the gpe device without typing in any
passwords.
